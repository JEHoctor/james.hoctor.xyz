I'm a machine learning engineer and a data scientist.
My interests include natural language processing, computer vision, and interpretable machine learning.
I hold an MS in Computer Science from Duke University, and a BS in Mathematics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

I enjoy competitive coding.
In 2019, I won second prize in the Duke AI for Art Competition with [Alina Jade Barnett](https://alinajadebarnett.github.io/).
In 2020, we were the 80th team from more than 100,000 global contestants to complete [part one day four](https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/day/4) of the annual Advent of Code challenges.
