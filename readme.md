# James Hoctor's blog

This repo is what I use to manage the content on my blog, [james.hoctor.xyz](https://james.hoctor.xyz/).
I also use this repo to deploy the blog.
If you are viewing this on GitHub, then you are looking at a copy, which is downstream of the working copy on my private git forge.
You can look at the automation I use to deploy the blog via forgejo actions, but those actions don't run on GitHub, and likely wouldn't work on GitHub.

The site is built with [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), a static site generator.
It is assumed that you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) from Astral installed.
